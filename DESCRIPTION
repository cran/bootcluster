Description: Implementation of the bootstrapping approach for the estimation of clustering stability and its application in estimating the number of clusters, as introduced by Yu et al (2016)<doi:10.1142/9789814749411_0007>. Implementation of the non-parametric bootstrap approach to assessing the stability of module detection in a graph, the extension for the selection of a parameter set that defines a graph from data in a way that optimizes stability and the corresponding visualization functions, as introduced by Tian et al (2021) <doi:10.1002/sam.11495>. Implemented out-of-bag stability estimation function and k-select Smin-based k-selection function as introduced by Liu et al (2022) <doi:10.1002/sam.11593>. Implemented ensemble clustering method based-on k-means clustering method, spectral clustering method and hierarchical clustering method.
